Hello, I'm Rachel Waymack

I am finishing my PhD in Developmental and Cell Biology at University of California, Irvine. 
I've used confocal microscopy, molecular biology, and computational methods to study novel mechanisms of transcriptional regulation during early Drosophila development.
I am interested in combining experimental and computation techniques to answer pressing biological questions. 
Feel free to reach out to me at rachelwaymack@gmail.com
